If you are using the Gruppo Trasporti Torinese bus service you may want to know when the bus you are waiting is going to arrive to the stop you are currently waiting. Since 5T, the company behind the information systems of GTT, does not have an official public API, I decided to create a library that scrapes real time data from the [official 5T-GTT website](http://www.5t.torino.it/5t/it/trasporto/arrivi-ricerca.jsp), to let any ruby coder use these data in their applications in a simple and reliable way. More on how to use it in the README of the open source [repository](https://github.com/StefanoOrdine/file_io_client).
