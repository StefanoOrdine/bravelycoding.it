File.io is a web service that let you upload a file and it gives you back an endpoint that can be used by anyone to download back the file. The service is completely ephimeral, so no logs are stored, the file is stored encrypded and automatically deleted ones it has been downloaded or the link has expired. I made a [Ruby client library](https://github.com/StefanoOrdine/file_io_client) to access this service programmatically by any ruby script. See the README on the repository for more details on how to use it.
